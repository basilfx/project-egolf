Tomorrow I will install the wiring for the new high-line rear view camera and
the TPMS. Hopefully, it will go very smoothly. Today I prepared the necessary
'accessories' for after the installation.

The new camera requires calibration. The dealer usually has a calibration
pattern (VAS6350). I do not want to spend money on this relatively simple step,
but I do need the calibration pattern. You can buy a cloth version on
AliExpress, ask a copy shop, or print it yourself. I chose the last option.

VAS6350 has the following dimensions:

It is quite large. I printed it on 28 pieces of A4 paper. I needed to use Foxit
PDF reader to print it as a poster, so its dimensions are accurate once
printed.

I think it took me a bit more than an hour to tape them all together. I used a
square and a measuring tape, and I pretty much nailed the dimensions and
squareness (within 2 mm). I do not believe that minor defects will make a
difference, since the camera likely does not have enough resolution to detect
them.
