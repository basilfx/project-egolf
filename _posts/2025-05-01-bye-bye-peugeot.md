Today I was finally able to pick up the car. As part of the deal, I sold my
Peugeot 206+ to the dealer. That made today the final day I drove that car.

The delivery experience was pleasant. The day before, I even received a
handwritten letter from the dealership, wishing me enjoyment and safe travels
with the new car. I thought this was a thoughtful gesture. When I arrived,
they had prepared my car in a dedicated delivery room. After completing the
formal procedures, such as transferring ownership, I received the keys and
was ready to go.

The first thing I did was take it for a short test drive. Since I had driven
quite a distance to the dealership, I preferred to make the first few kilometers
near the dealership, just to be sure everything was in order. I also verified
using OBDEleven whether they had resolved the issues I identified during the
test drive, which they had.

## Autoscan
I also created an autoscan and adaption channel maps using VCDS. You can find
these [here][1]. Apart from the [navigation update][2], it is as how I received
the vehicle from the dealership.
