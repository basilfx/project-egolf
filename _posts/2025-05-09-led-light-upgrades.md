The e-Golf uses LED lighting in almost every area. Only two places still used
halogen lights: the glove box and the trunk.

The glove box light has part number `7L0 947 415`, which I replaced with
`5G0 947 409`. Interestingly, this light is also used for footwell lighting.
Although my car does not have footwell lighting, the LED version appears in
the parts catalog for the e-Golf in 2018, which makes me wonder why Volkswagen
did not use LED for the glove box light.

At the time the car was produced, no LED alternative was available for the
trunk light. The original trunk light has part number `5K0 947 101`. I replaced
this with part number `2K5 947 101 B`, which has been installed on Tiguans
since 2021. The replacement was straightforward: use a plastic trim removal
tool on the long edge of the light to gently pull it from its socket.

Both lights are direct fits and did not require any coding. There were also no
faults. During the day, they are not as bright as some AliExpress alternatives,
but at night they provide sufficient illumination.
