When you buy a Golf GTD, GTE, GTI, or R-line spec car, you will receive much
nicer looking pedals. My e-Golf did not come with them, but they are very easy
to retrofit.

Volkswagen and AUDI use the same part numbers:

* Accelerator pedal: `5Q1 721 647 A`
* Brake pedal: `5Q0 723 131 A`
* Footrest: `5Q1 864 551 A`

Note: the part numbers are different for manual transmission vehicles.

I opted for original parts, but second-hand. After all, they get dirty and
used the second you put your foot on them. The price difference between an
aftermarket kit and what I paid for second-hand parts is not that significant.

The accelerator pedal I bought came from an AUDI A3, the brake pedal from a
Volkswagen T-Roc, and the footrest from a Volkswagen Golf 7.5 GTE. They were
in good condition and looked like new after some cleaning.

## The installation

Installation of the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal is straightforward.
In my case, only the brake pedal had a rubber cover that I could slide off,
after which I installed the new one. The accelerator pedal was a bit trickier,
but with the help of some plastic trim tools I managed to make it work. The
rubber backing of the new pedals had to slide over the old one, but because
the rubber is quite hard, it required some convincing. Nothing too difficult
though.

For the footrest, you need to remove a few trim pieces because the large trim
slides over the footrest. I am not going over the process of removing these
trims, as there are excellent video tutorials on YouTube. I recommend
[this one][1] by mr-fix.

The result looks much better.
