I decided to buy the retrofit kit with part number `5G1 052 200 C`. As
explained [last week][1], this is an official kit provided by Volkswagen for
the Golf 7.5. The price I paid was more competitive than buying the four tail
lights second-hand and sourcing the wiring separately. The only remaining item
I need to purchase is the set of replacement connectors, part number
`1K8 972 928 B`.

Once I receive the new connectors, I will start retrofitting the lights. Until
then, there is not much more to tell.
