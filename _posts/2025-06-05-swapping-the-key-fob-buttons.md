When I bought the vehicle, it was quite clear which of the two keys was used
the most, even for a vehicle with keyless entry (KESSY). The buttons on one of
the two remotes were slightly dented. I bought new buttons to replace the old
ones on AliExpress.

Replacing them is straightforward. Begin by removing the battery cover. I then
removed the metallic piece by taking out the screw and sliding it off. I did
not have the Torx screwdriver in my main set, but I believe it was a T6. Using
a plastic pry tool, I then took off the plastic side piece. Then simply remove
the old buttons and install the new ones.

Putting it back together is the reverse process.

I compared the quality of the two buttons, and honestly, I have a hard time
remembering which one was the replacement.
