I have spent quite some time sitting in the car, coding the vehicle with a
laptop on my lap. Even with the seat moved to its furthest position, it was
still far from comfortableâ€”especially when entering or exiting the vehicle.
I do not have a garage to work in. Otherwise, I would probably use a mobile
cart to place my laptop on.

3D printing is another hobby of mine. I found [this][1] tablet holder by
SpectreGadget on [printables.com][2], and printed it on my Creality Ender 3
V3 Plus in PETG. The model was designed for an AUDI steering wheel, which I
thought is quite similar to a steering wheel of a Volkswagen. The print came
out very nice and sturdy. I rounded the edges at the top part, so that it
cannot damage the steering wheel.

A few years ago, I bought a cheap 10-inch Windows tablet. I never had a use
for it, but I figured it would work fine for this application. I prepped the
tablet with VCDS, and now I have a much better way to code whilst sitting in
the car.

Although the tablet has a touchscreen, I still prefer to use a Bluetooth
mouse. I use the on-screen keyboard when necessary, given that I only use it
to search for adaptions. It works well enough.
