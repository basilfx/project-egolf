It is still a little over a week before the car is ready for pickup, but that
has not stopped me from looking into the possible modifications I can do. There
are plenty of sources to find small coding-related changes. But some sources
go one step further.

I want to do these mods simply because I can. I enjoy the research â€” finding
out what is possible, which parts I need, and eventually installing them. The
car is already seven years old. Some might ask: is it worth it? I plan to
keep this car for quite some time, so doing the upgrades now makes more sense
than waiting a few more years.

I got a lot of inspiration from the following posts:

* [Golf 7 Everything Possible][1]
* [ciclo. Wife's Golf MK7.5 Ready2Go][2]

So here is the list of mods I want to do:

* Retrofitting Active Info Display (AID) ([part 1][a1]), [part 2][a2])
* Enabling predictive-ACC (pACC)
* Installing tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) ([part 1][c1],
  [part 2][c2], [part 3][c3])
* Replace pedals with R-style pedals ([here][d1])
* Install exterior temperature AND humidity sensor ([here][e1])
* Add ambient footwell lighting
* Upgrade trunk lighting ([here][g1])
* Upgrade camera from low-line (KA1) to high-line (KA2) ([part 1][h1],
  [part 2][h2], [part 3][h3], [part 4][h4])
* Door exit lights
* Retrofit ESC button ([part 1][j1])
* Dynamic tail lights ([part 1][k1], [part 2][k2])
* USB-C instead of USB-A

Of course, there will also be the [necessary][z1] [coding][z2] and adaptions.
You can find the full autoscan and adaption channel mappings referred to in the
posts [here][z3] and [here][z4].
