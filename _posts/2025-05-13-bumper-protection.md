I know the car is not new. The rear bumper has some scratches due to hauling
stuff over the bumper. Preventing further damage is easy by installing a bumper
protection film. On the other cars I own(ed), I also installed something
similar. I chose to install a transparent one, which was easy to apply using
plenty of soapy water.

I managed to install it with only two small dust particles trapped underneath.
I am OK with that. Trying to remove them will probably damage the film.
